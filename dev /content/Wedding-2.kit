            <p>
                This level of service can take on a host of characteristics, tailored to the specific event and client at hand.  Each client has their own needs, their own busy careers and each venue is so different.We do take on  weddings with reception planning.  Our team of vendors/the client’s surrounding circum -stances will align with our company’s level of quality. Additionally, usually these weddings take place during the less popular months or they have a very short lead time.
