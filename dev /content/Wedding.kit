                    <p>Weddings are super personal and intimate. You are surrounded by your closest family and friends, and it’s probably the first time you will see this group of people together in the same room. There is so much significance around your wedding day and it’s important you select the right team who knows how to get the job done, while also respecting your privacy on such an intimate day. Your wedding is not just another event for us and we believe that wedding planning is much more than an event checklist.  </p>

                This level of service can take on a host of characteristics, tailored to the specific event and client at hand.  Each client has their own needs, their own busy careers and each venue is so different.We do take on  weddings with reception planning.  Our team of vendors/the client’s surrounding circum -stances will align with our company’s level of quality. Additionally, usually these weddings take place during the less popular months or they have a very short lead time.
